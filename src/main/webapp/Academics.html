<h2><b>Academics</b></h2>
<div>
<p><i>A group of co-related streams of different departments is headed by a Dean of the school and
each branch/department is headed by head of the department. The staff members of each department
are allotted portfolios such as Year coordinator, Mentor, time-table incharge, placement coordinator etc.
Curriculum and syllabus are designed by each department every four years based on feedbacks from
alumni, experts from academia and industry. Board of Studies and academic council approves the
Curriculum and syllabus.<br><br>
Choice Based Credit System, a learner-centric approach allows a student to study crossdiscipline courses along with the primary programme where the student is enrolled into. It allows the
students to choose the courses from a set of core courses/ electives offered either within the school or
between schools. Students can choose from basic/ advanced/ foundation courses hence providing
greater flexibility in the choice of courses.<br><br>
Two different sets of courses are offered for students namely programme electives and open
electives. Programme electives include the courses ranging from fundamentals to advanced courses
pertaining to programme of study. In open electives, foundation and advanced courses across the
schools are offered.<br><br>
Assessment involves two Continuous Assessment Examinations, assignments and End
Semester Examinations and credits are then transferred. It develops holistic knowledge in students
thereby enhancing his employability/ entrepreneurship skills.<br><br>
Flexible subject system has been imposed from 2015 regulations and this enables choice
based staff selection (CBSS) where students are encouraged to select staff members of their choice for particular subjects in every semester. This enables a minimum flexibility in the curriculum. This is an
initiative for flexibility in curriculum design.</i></p>
